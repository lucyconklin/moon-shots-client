# Moon Shots Client

This is a client application for the [Moon Shots API](https://github.com/lucyconklin/moon_shots_api).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting started

`npm start`

navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see it in action.

## Improvements
1. Refactor using ES6 to clean up some of those bindings

1. Use styled-components more effectively with props - maybe to style errors or tasting notes

1. Refactor some of the class components to be functional components

1. New Feature: De-orbit or detonate satellites

1. Improvement: I think the errors column is only showing one error right now, but there should be many.

1. Improvement: Most of the filtering is still happening on the backend, we could just fetch all the data and skip sending the search term
